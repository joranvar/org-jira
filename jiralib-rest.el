;;; Code:
(defun rest-json-sync-call (base-url resource &optional method &rest data)
  "Call the REST method on BASE-URL/RESOURCE.

The http method METHOD is used, defaulting to GET.  If present,
the extra DATA (as a plist) is encoded to json and sent along.

Returns a cons of the response status code and the response data,
encoded as a alist.

Example:

  (rest-json-sync-call \"http://rest.example.com\" \"/thing\"
		       \"POST\"
		       :name \"myThing\" :color \"blue\")

  â‡’ (200 . (thing (id . 1) (name . \"myThing\") (color . \"blue\")))"
  (let ((request (request
		  (concat base-url resource)
		  :type (or method "GET")
		  :data (and data (json-encode data))
		  :headers (and data '(("Content-Type" . "application/json")))
		  :parser (lambda () (let ((json-object-type 'alist)) (json-read)))
		  :sync t)))
    (cons (request-response-status-code request)
