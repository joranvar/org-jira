#+TITLE: Still to do in this project

* Change the signatures of functions
Especially in [[file:jiralib.el::(defun%20jiralib-link-issue%20(issue-key%20link-type%20other-issue-key)][jiralib-link-issue]], as the link-type could partially be
applied to get a more specific function. This will also help with the
doc string ;)

This (the better doc string) will also be the case in
[[file:org-jira.el::(defun%20org-jira-get-from-org%20(type%20entry)][org-jira-get-from-org]].

* Allow fetching of issue trees
This is more org-mode like. Perhaps the link between children and
parents should be stored in the a "Parent_link_type" property in each
child, so as not to be confused when updating or fetching again. This
probably would also be more convenient if there were more "get
children of specific type" interactive functions, such as "get
children from epic", or, indeed, "get epics from project".

* Refactor these functions, they're too large
[[file:org-jira.el::(defun%20org-jira-get-issues%20(issues)][file:org-jira.el::(defun org-jira-get-issues (issues)]]
[[file:org-jira.el::(defun%20org-jira-update-comments-for-current-issue%20()][file:org-jira.el::(defun org-jira-update-comments-for-current-issue ()]]

* Reread some functions for understanding
E.g. [[file:org-jira.el::(defun%20org-jira-get-comment-body%20(&optional%20comment-id)][org-jira-get-comment-body]]
